        The NHSN is the CDC's healthcare-associated infection tracking system. Hospitals enrolled in NHSN
        submit data on antimicrobial use (AU), antimicrobial resistance (AR), and healthcare-associated
        infections (HAI). AEGIS automates data collection, aggregation, and formatting for all three modules.
    </p>
    <ol style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
        <li><strong>Antimicrobial Use (AU)</strong> -- Monthly submission of Days of Therapy (DOT) and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) by agent, route, and location.</li>
        <li><strong>Antimicrobial Resistance (AR)</strong> -- Quarterly submission of isolate counts with resistance phenotype classification using the first-isolate rule.</li>
        <li><strong>HAI Events</strong> -- Individual event reporting for CLABSI, CAUTI, VAE, SSI, CDI, and MRSA bacteremia using NHSN event definitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Denominator Data</strong> -- Monthly patient-days and device-days by location, used to calculate rates and device utilization ratios.</li>

                    If a patient receives vancomycin on Monday and Tuesday, that is 2 DOT for vancomycin.

                    DDD is designed for adult use. In pediatric settings like CCHMC, DOT is preferred because
                    pediatric doses are weight-based and often far below adult DDD values.
